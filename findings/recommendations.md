# Recommendations

Based on the controls and compliance assessment, the IT manager should consider the following:

- Implement role-based access and least privilege policies for all employees.  
- Deploy a full disaster recovery plan and regular backups for critical systems.  
- Enforce password policies with a centralized management system.  
- Install an intrusion detection system (IDS) for monitoring potential threats.  
- Encrypt all cardholder and sensitive customer data to comply with PCI DSS.  
- Ensure GDPR and SOC policies are fully enforced and employees trained on data handling.  
- Create a formal schedule for legacy system monitoring and maintenance.
